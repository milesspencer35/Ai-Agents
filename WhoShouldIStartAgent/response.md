1) Start: Travis Etienne Jr.

2) Confidence: Medium-High
- Etienne is the clear lead back with big Week 1 usage/efficiency and even firmer hold on the job after Jacksonville moved Tank Bigsby. Henderson looked good, but he’s in a committee behind Rhamondre Stevenson on a Patriots offense that’s still finding its footing.

3) Key factors
- Role and volume: Etienne handled 19 touches (16 carries, 3 catches) for 156 yards in Week 1 and is entrenched as the feature back under new HC Liam Coen; Jacksonville trading Bigsby this week further consolidates the backfield behind Etienne. ([nbcsports.com](https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/travis-etienne-jaguars-blow-out-panthers-26-10?utm_source=openai), [si.com](https://www.si.com/nfl/jaguars/travis-etienne-carolina-panthers-jacksonville-liam-coen-trevor-lawrence?utm_source=openai), [bigcatcountry.com](https://www.bigcatcountry.com/jacksonville-jaguars-news/76885/trade-jaguars-send-tank-bigsby-to-the-eagles-for-2026-draft-picks?utm_source=openai))
- Matchups and trends: Bengals were mid-pack versus RBs last season (20.0 PPR points allowed per game) and in Week 1 held Cleveland’s runners in check on the ground but yielded 8 RB receptions—usage Etienne can tap if JAX trails. Miami allowed the Colts to score on all seven possessions (Jonathan Taylor 18-71), but New England split backfield work (Stevenson 9 touches; Henderson 11, with 6 catches).

- Conditions/game script: Outdoor weather looks ideal in Cincinnati (mid-80s, dry) versus stormy, hot Miami, which can sap offenses and tilt the Pats toward Stevenson’s early-down/goal-line work. JAX@CIN and NE@MIA are both Sunday, Sep 14.

4) Risk assessment
- Etienne: Bengals’ front just smothered Cleveland’s rushing (Browns RBs 18 carries for 40 yards combined) and CIN is favored at home; a negative script could trim early-down volume, making you rely on receiving.

- Henderson: Committee risk and low TD equity (goal-line likely Stevenson). If NE plays from behind again, Henderson’s targets help in PPR, but total touches may stay in the 8–12 range.

5) Projected points (PPR, Week 2)
- Travis Etienne Jr.: 16–20 points (80–100 total yards, 3–4 receptions, ~50% TD probability). ([nbcsports.com](https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/travis-etienne-jaguars-blow-out-panthers-26-10?utm_source=openai))
- TreVeyon Henderson: 9–13 points (45–70 total yards, 3–5 receptions, low TD odds). ([cbssports.com](https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/patriots-treveyon-henderson-clears-50-total-yards-in-debut/?utm_source=openai))

Notes you can use:
- JAX at Bengals (Sun, Sep 14, 1 p.m. ET) and NE at Dolphins (Sun, Sep 14, 1 p.m. ET). Weather: Cincinnati pleasant; Miami hot with scattered thunderstorms. Recheck Friday practice reports, but no current injury flags for either back.

Bottom line: Start the every-down runner in a stable role (Etienne) over the rookie in a split (Henderson) in PPR this week.
